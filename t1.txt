EXT. PUNJAB - NIGHT

1

India Pakistan Border in Punjab. There is a Sign board that
says so.
Some distance away, we see a lamppost, with a blown out lamp
head and an election poster of an Indian Political party
stuck to its column. Hiding in the tall grass next to it are
two young boys with a motorbike.
Suddenly a whistle is heard. Four rucksacks are thrown across
from the Pakistani side on to the Indian side.
The two young guys turn and look at where the bags have
landed. They wait for a bit. Checking if there is any patrol
unit that could have been alerted.
When they sense the coast is clear, they run in crouched
below the tall grass to the rucksacks. One of them picks up a
bag. His expression shows something is not right. The weight
is completely off. It is extremely light.
He opens the bag. Inside the whole bag is stuffed with old
newspapers.
BOY 1
Painchod. Maal kitthe hega?
The other boy has opened the other bags.
BOY 2
Saare bags de vich ta akhbar hi
akhbar hege..
Boy 1 makes a call.
BOY 1
Pritpal praji, bags de vich ta koi
maal hi nahi hega, purane akhbar
pai henge (are lying) enade vich
... Koi maal nai!

I/E. DHABA IN PATHANKOT - DAY

2

An Ambulance drives into the parking area of a Dhaba. The
Ambulance has SAY NO TO DRUGS emblazoned on one side.
Two men get out of the Ambulance. 54 year old, Pritpal Singh.
The other guy who gets off is a lean man dressed in all white
is Neerav Mittal

2.
They enter the Dhaba and walk into the back of the Dhaba.
A secret section where the Dhaba serves alcohol to their
select clientele.
They see a tough looking bearded man of around 40 is sitting
on a table.
PRITPAL SINGH
Iqbal, eh kis taranh da mazak hega?
IQBAL
Pritpal paaji,ethe aao, pehle tan
ik jhappi paa lo. Aao, aao.
He hugs Pritpal who’s a bit reticent.
IQBAL (cont'd)
Haal ki hai Neerav praji da
NEERAV MITTAL
Theek he oh eh, tussi dasso?
IQBAL
Behjao praaji. Pehle tan.. kal raat
di gal vaaste... sorry. Actually,
assi ikn test run kar rae sige.
PRITPAL SINGH
Test run! Kede vaaste? Maheenein ho

IQBAL
Raaste te doubt nahi hega praaji,

ISI ne ode vaaste ik test run kita,
Eh dekkhan vaaste ki BSF wale onoo
pakad paande hain ki nahi. Test
pass ho jaooga, tan pher oh asli
maal phejange...
Iqbal switches on the tab he has. It goes into a video call.
On the other side Mushtaq Khan, 35, Slicked back hair,
mustachioed, extremely cold face man comes on.
IQBAL (cont'd)
Mushtaq Sir, Pritpal ji mere saath
hi hai.
Pritpal and Neerav both get a bit subservient in posture when
they see Mushtaq Khan.
PRITPAL SINGH
Eh... Captain Farooq dikhai nahi de
rahe.

3.
MUSHTAQ KHAN
Unka tabadla ho gaya hai, Pritpal
ji. Ab se main aapka handler hoon.
PRITPAL SINGH
Oh, acha. Chalo theek hai, koi gal
nahin.
MUSHTAQ KHAN
Iqbal ne aapko khabar di hogi,
aapko mere liye ek bohot hi aham
kaam karna hai.
PRITPAL SINGH
Tussi order do Mushtaq bhai. Hum
toh baithe hi hai aapki seva mein.
MUSHTAQ KHAN
Ek package hai, jisse Punjab ke ek
purane aatankwadi group ke paas
pahuchaana hai.
Drugs?

PRITPAL SINGH

MUSHTAQ KHAN
Nahi, par lekar jaana hai jaise
Amreeka se laaya hua chitta ho.
PRITPAL SINGH
Ho jayega Mushtaq bhai. Kahan
pahuchaana hai?
MUSHTAQ KHAN
Aapke hi kuch purane dost hai, 80s
ke time se. Aajkal utni harkatein
nahi karte hai, par bagawat ka
jazbaa toh zinda hoga. Ek baar
Iqbal se milwa dijiye unko, phir
jab package ready ho jayega, hum
italla kar denge.
Neerav Mittal, looks extremely nervous now.
PRITPAL SINGH
Sir, jazbaa tan zinda hai.. bas
thodajya kamzor pe gaya... Kya hoga
aapke package mein? Mera matlab...
mere kol tan ikoi ambulance hegi..
MUSHTAQ KHAN
Uski fikr na kariye. Ambulance ki
hi zaroorat hai humein. Is kaam ki
moti keemat milegi.
(looks at Iqbal)
Iqbal?
Iqbal nods, Mushtaq continues.

4.
MUSHTAQ KHAN (cont'd)
Toh zara hoshiyari se, Pritpal ji.
Chaliye, dobara call karta hoon...
khushi hui aapse milke.
With the mention of the reward, Pritpal is now fine with the
deal.
PRITPAL SINGH
Saanoo bhi, Mushtaq bhai.
The screen dies. Iqbal takes out a pouch and rolls a diamond
on the table. Pritpal looks at Neerav. Neerav checks the
diamond out with a Jeweler’s loupe. Satisfied with the
authenticity of the stone, Neerav nods. Iqbal extends his
hand.
IQBAL
Apne doston se meeting fix karwa lo
praji, agla payment bhi aa jayega.
Pritpal smiles. However, Neerav looks extremely edgy.

INT. SOUTH BLOCK, SAILESH'S CABIN - DAY
The door of the inner cabin opens and Pradeep walks in with
Imtiaz. General Saha and Sailesh are already waiting there
for them.
GENERAL SAHA
These are the boys. Capt Pradeep
Bhattacharya, Capt Imtiaz Ahmed.
SAILESH
Congratulation officers on a job
well done.
PRADEEP
Thank you sir, par cross karne ka
go ahead toh aapne hi diya tha.
SAILESH
Haan, par uski aadat mat daal lena
Captain. Uski aag bureaucratic
channels mein abhi tak lagi hui hai
IMTIAZ
Sir, ussi aag se hum Zafar ko rok
paaye. I think that was critical to
set back the enemy.

SAILESH
Well gentlemen, I’ll take that any
day. Captain Pradeep, I think aapki
forensic auditing skills aur
intelligence networks se humein aur
bhi faayda ho sakta hai.
PRADEEP
(Extremely inspired)
Sir, I’m always at the service of
the nation.
(pause)
I think humein money trail ko
follow karna chahiye. Zafar sirf ek
hired technician tha, jisse bomb
banane ka kaam diya gaya tha. Mera
maanna hai ki yeh ISI ki normal
functioning nahi hai. Is poore plan
mein koi aur bada, chalaak player
involved hai.
SAILESH
Quite possible.
(turns to Saha)
Where are we with the RDX?
GENERAL SAHA
We’re on it Sir, NIA ko bhi
activate kar diya gaya hai.
SAILESH
Right. Par control ATFTF ke paas hi
rehna chahiye. Har pal updates lete
rahiye.
(pause)
ISIS ke paas ek poora roster hai,
containing video lessons to make
bombs. It won’t be long before some
new radical kid on the block learns
a new skill. Kabhi bhi ek naya
Zafar Hamidi paida ho sakta hai. So
we have to be careful. Goodluck,
officers!
There is an ominous ring to what he says and the reactions of
the people in the room endorse that. They quickly hurry out.

EHSAAN WAZIRI

Naye plan se woh nateeje kabhi nahi

INT. INTERNATIONAL TAXATION DIVISION - DAY

Early morning. The office is empty. Only Pradeep’s cabin has
its light on. The first staffers are just walking in.
Inside we see Pradeep is working on files that he’s got from
the ATFTF.
Sukhdev comes in and is surprised to see Pradeep in his
cabin. Sukhdev walks in.
SUKHDEV
Good morning sir. Aaj itni jaldi?
Gulati sir ko khush karne ke liye
dugni mehnat kar rahe ho?

7.
PRADEEP
(Laughs)
Dugni? Pehle wali mehnat toh kar
loon, phir dugni ki sochunga.
Sukhdev looks at the notes that Pradeep has made on the open
pads before him. He looks at the screen. Figures the stuff is
not office related.
SUKHDEV
Wah! Aapka toh iraada bhi nahi lag
raha hai. Movie theater mein baith
ke aap toh online shopping kar rahe
ho. You are very dedicated, sir.
Right then Gulati walks up.
GULATI
Dedicated? For what?
SUKHDEV
Good Morning sir.
PRADEEP
Good morning sir. We were just
talking... about how I want to
dedicate some time to our division
GULATI
Kyun bhai? Desh surakshit ho gaya
humara?
PRADEEP
Eh...sir...not exactly...but..
GULATI
(cutting in)
Dekho Pradeep, hum log tax collect
karte hai. Woh tax jo sarkaar ki
jeb mein jaata hai. Usse desh ki
suraksha hoti hai, you know...
(pause)
So essentially hum sabhi desh ki
suraksha kar rahe hain, hai na? Aur
phir, meri, tumhari, hum sab ki
salaries bhi toh ussi paise se aati
hai.
PRADEEP
(straight-faced)
Right, sir.
GULATI
Humare kaafi matters pending hai,
koi bhi case utha lo. For the
security of the nation... right?

8.
PRADEEP
Sure, sir. Waise bhi abhi ek
maheene kahin nahi jaa raha hoon.
Yahin se desh ko secure rakhunga.
GULATI
Badi meherbaani tumhaari. Kabhi
kabhi toh mujhe lagta hai ki tum
mere liye nahi, main tumhare liye
kaam karta hoon.
(pause)
But, goodluck! See you around.
He walks away. Sukhdev laughs. Pradeep glares at him.
Pradeep’s phone rings. It says Ramlogan, Seychelles. Pradeep
switches it on.
PRADEEP
Hi Ramlogan, kya haal hai?
RAMLOGAN
Sab theek hai Pradeep. Ek aisi
khabar mili hai ki aapko agle saal
ki Swiss vacation bhi book karni
padegi.
Pradeep laughs.
PRADEEP
By all means Ramlogan. Meri savings
tumhare liye hi toh hai.
(smirks)
Batao, kya khabar hai?
RAMLOGAN
Aapko yaad hai ki maine aapko
bataya tha ki Green Tribe

EXT. BASTAR FORESTS - DAY

It is quite dark inside the dense forests despite it being
early evening. Parveena dressed in camouflage is walking with
an 8 year old boy who’s one hand is in a plaster. At one
point we see a small police picket with CRPF guarding it.
The boy who’s spotted the picket from a distance, raises his
hands. Parveena stops. The boy signals to her. They start
walking back and then turn off the forest path.

11.
Next Shot: Deep behind the police picket, Parveena and the
Boy cross them crouched behind the thick shrubbery.
Next Shot: Parveena and the boy reach a small clearing
inside the forest which has a temporary dwelling, well
guarded by the MAOISTs. They look at the boy first and then
Parveena. They raise their guns. The boy is least perturbed.
He goes straight to the guns and lowers one.
BOY

ANAND BHAIYA
Madam, aap keh rahi hai ki humein

aap log karenge?
PARVEENA
Ji. Waise bhi, Russia aur Eastern
Bloc ke jaane ke baad se aapki
funding kaafi cut ho chuki hai.
China aapse baat nahi karega kyunki
unke khayalat aapke krantikari

Yakeen nahi ho raha... aisa bhi toh

PARVEENA
Yakeen toh aankhon mein aankhein

phir bhi aapke liye saboot le kar
aayi thi, woh toh aapke logon ne
mera phone aur laptop chheen liya.
ANAND BHAIYA
Humara laptop istemaal kar lijiye.
Next Shot: A beat up laptop is logging on to the internet.
Parveena types up a page. SOAS protests. A few images come
up. Parveena shows him one.

12.
PARVEENA
Yeh main hoon. Hamesha se hi is
soch, is ilm se judi rahi hoon. Aur
mere saath aur bhi log hai, jo ek
secret crowd fund chalate hai, un
krantikariyon ke liye jinhe paise

Bolivia... humne sab jagah madad

Anand Bhaiya thaws a bit towards her.
ANAND BHAIYA
Theek hai. Toh kab aayega aapka
paisa?
PARVEENA
Kuch hafton mein. Par humari raay
hai ki attack December ke pehle
hafte mein hi hona chahiye.
ANAND BHAIYA
Madam, attack ki baat tab karenge
jab aapke paise aa jayenge.
PARVEENA
Beshak. Waise, main kahin nahi jaa

set up kar rahi hoon, operation ko
speed up karne ke liye. Toh hum
milte rahenge...
Anand Bhaiya signals to a female revolutionary.
ANAND BHAIYA
Yeh aapko bahar ka raasta dikha

She starts to walk away with the Female Revolutionary. At one
point she stops. Her eyes brighten up. She turns.

EXT. HIGHWAY TOLL BOOTH, RAJASTHAN - DAY

There are many police teams standing in the toll booth. The
Highway Patrol, City Police, IB team in plain clothes,
District Police. Imtiaz and Sanjay are with them. A car comes

him.
PRADEEP
Kya update hai, Captain?
IMTIAZ
Yeh last toll booth tha jo us truck
ne cross kiya.
Pradeep looks around.
PRADEEP
I guess yeh area poora hi
industrial hai.
Imtiaz nods, pulls up the map on his tab. As he speaks, he
draws out a region on the map. From the toll booth 5kms
straight on the highway.
IMTIAZ
Correct. Infact, yahan se kareeb 10
square kilometre tak sirf factories
hi hai. Truck agar is taraf gaya
hoga toh zyada se zyada 5 kilometre
ke radius mein unload karke hi
lauta hoga.
PRADEEP
How can you be sure?
IMTIAZ

Tumhara kaam gut feel se chalta

Imtiaz shows Pradeep a Print Grab of the truck from the CCTV.
And then another one with a different time stamp.
IMTIAZ (cont'd)
Yeh capture kareeb dhai ghante baad
ka hai, ismein wohi truck waapis
jaata hua dikh raha hai.
(pause)
Since there is lot of traffic on
this highway, the truck couldnt
have possibly gone outside this
circle.
From the point on the map, about 5 kms away, Imtiaz draws
half a circle with the toll booth as the center.
IMTIAZ (cont'd)
Koi bhi factory, shed, garage,
building ho sakti hai. Par is
circle ke bahar nahi.
PRADEEP
Logic sahi hai Captain, par aise
industrial area mein ek particular
truck ko dhoondhna Don ko pakadne
se bhi zyada mushkil hone wala hai.
(smirks)
IMTIAZ
I know. Par aajkal sabhi factories
mein CCTV cameras hote hai. Humare
paas truck ka make, aur photo bhi
hai. Sanjay please share the
pictures with the whole team.
Sanjay walks over to the other personnel and starts handing

Finally the Paper Rolls that have arrived from the Supplier

attached to the first part of the mint and it moves the paper
through the processes till the part where they start pushing
out paper which goes up on spindles and rises to the ceiling
where they’re left to dry hanging as a really long piece of
cloth in a kind of wave like position. And the paper is
filled with prints of 1000 rupee Indian Notes
Camera crosses the drying papers to reveal Jan Kott with
Waziri and General Aziz. They’re standing next to a cutting
area where the paper is being cut into smaller sections and
then fed precisely into a stack which then further cuts the
notes into the right size. Then these stacks of cut notes are
spewed out into a receptacle tray from where they’re moved
into a conveyor belt where many poor women sit counting and
making bundles.
GENERAL AZIZ

INT.FATHIMA NATIONAL SCHOOL, SRI LANKA - DAY

17

A very Sri Lankan Tamil School. A central courtyard. The two
opposing sides of the courtyard has large rooms in which
classes are taking place.

19.
Shamas, is escorted by someone from the place up a narrow
flight of stairs. They reach a very large spacious room which
has a large table and metal chairs, almost like a dining area
of sorts. A 60 year old man, wearing an all black Thobe with
ornate embroidery, is busy getting his propaganda speech
edited by a young guy sitting behind a small editing setup.
On the computer the Maulvi is seen speaking.

Naga pesurathu unmaiyana islam ,
thooimaiyana Islam. Intha melatheya

MAULVI JAINUL
Itha nan solli mudikekka nalla
palamana music ah poodu
He turns to see the new entrant who greets the old Maulvi.
SHAMAS
Shamas Mustafi.
MAULVI JAINUL
Shamas. Aapka kehna ki aapko kisi
jaan-pehchaan wale ne bheja hai.
SHAMAS
Ji, Maulvi saab. Aap ijaazat de
toh...
Maulvi Jainul thinks for a moment, then nods.Shamas connects
to the dark web chat. General Aziz appears on screen. Besides
him we see Waziri. They’re sitting in the office of the mint.
GENERAL AZIZ
Maulvi Saahab!! Assalam Valekum.
Maulvi Jainul looks shocked. He turns to the editor.
MAULVI JAINUL
Ehi oivu ondu edduthutu va da pa
(To the guy who brought
Shamas up)
Neeyum thaan
The two leave. The Maulvi now speaks to Aziz.
MAULVI JAINUL (cont'd)
Waalaikum assalaam General saab,
aap? Humein toh laga ki aapse
guftagoo karna toh humare protocol
mein nahi hai.

20.
GENERAL AZIZ
Isiliye toh ek bohot hi secure
channel se haazir ho raha hoon,
Maulvi saab. Maine suna hai ki
aapka Sri Lanka wala division zoro
shoro se tarakki kar raha hai.
MAULVI JAINUL
Jo sataaye jaate hai, woh rone ke
liye ek kandha dhoondte hai, aur
waapas vaar karne ke liye ek
saathi. Chahein kahin bhi ho.
GENERAL AZIZ
Maulvi saab, mere yeh dost thodi
madad chahte hai.
EHSAAN WAZIRI
Assalam Valekum, Maulvi saab. Meri
pehchaan Ehsaan Waziri hai.
MAULVI JAINUL
Valekum assalam, Ehsaan miyan.
Bataiye, kya kar sakte hain aapki
khidmat mein?
EHSAAN WAZIRI
(points above)
Khidmat toh humein aapki karni
chahiye, uska kaam jo kar rahe hain
(pause)
Filhaal, toh ek choti si arzi thi.
Ek ladka aapke yahan aaya hoga,
Shamas. Uska introduction karana
hai... George Prabhakar se.
MAULVI JAINUL
George? Woh Tiger Group wala? Woh
toh kab se apne gut ko chhod Tamil
Nadu chala gaya hai. Woh kya kaam
aayega? Unke group ki toh harkat
aur josh dono hi thanda pada hai.
EHSAAN WAZIRI
Aap bas ek baar pehchaan karwa
dijiye. Humare paas unke josh ko
jagaane ki dawaai hai, jo jald hi
aapke paas pahuchayi jaa rahi hai.
Aapko apne logon aur kashtiyon ka
istemaal karna padega, dariya ke
paar George tak woh dawai
pahuchaane ke liye.

21.
MAULVI JAINUL
(turns to Aziz)
Kya General saab, hum yahan
bandookon ki nalliyaan saaf kar
rahe hai aur aap goliyaan kisi aur
ko de rahe hain? Eelam aur George
ab khatam ho chuke hain. Unko
chhodiye, hum kis din kaam aayenge?
Ehsaan and Aziz exchange a look, as Aziz comes forward.
GENERAL AZIZ
Maulvi saab, haathi ke daant
dikhaane ke alag aur khaane ke alag
hote hain. Aap ke saath toh aur bhi
mukaam baaki hai haasil karne ko.
Filhaal, humein zaroorat ek Tamil
group ki hai, jo yeh kaam kar sake,
aur agar is kaam mein haathi ke
daant nakkashi ke liye cut bhi
jaaye, toh kum se kum uska pet toh
bhara rahega.
(pause)
Aap samajh rahe hai na, is kaam ki
shinakht aap ya hum tak nahi
pahuchni chahiye.
The Maulvi gets it. He nods.

Abhi kaun hai?

Dekh na kaun aaya hai bhonsdike?
One goon looks out. They can make out 2 men standing outside.
Pradeep and Imtiaz move back to get a good look at any
other entry to the place.
The goon who’s looking notices the Wireless handset in
Imtiaz’s hand.

The Goons have one guy giving them cover fire as they retreat
to the back. Suleiman joins the shooting. Imtiaz on seeing
Sanjay and his team.

earnest now. The Goons with their AKs
Pradeep and Imtiaz are armed only with their Pistols
More cops arrive and join the firefight from different sides.
The Goons try to shoot their way out.
However, the goons are in no mood to surrender. They know
they’re screwed with the RDX in the place. They try and get
away, by running into some lanes. Suleiman is seen throwing
his mobile into a drain. He rushes out shooting.
However, since the search operation involved a huge number of
cops, they get shot down when they try and escape.
Within minutes of the firefight the 4 goons and Suleiman find
themselves riddled with bullets.

pats his back one time and then walks to discuss the
inventory with the IB teams.
Pradeep moves to the Driver’s cabin of the Generator. He sees
the freshly pasted number plate on White Self Adhesive paper.
He sees 4 pieces. two for MP and two for Chhattisgarh.

Imtiaz comes and looks at the Number plates.

the paint on it is freshly done.
